\chapter{Contribution}

The main contribution in this thesis is to provide an active automaton learning framework, which can be used to support system design and analysis. This framework, since used in system design, is easily modifiable and extensible, while having the capability of handling any variation of formalisms systems might use.
\\
In order to approach such a framework, the right tooling is necessary.
